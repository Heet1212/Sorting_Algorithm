Welcome to the Sorting Algorithms Repository! This repository provides a collection of sorting algorithms implemented in Python programming languages.
It serves as a valuable resource for understanding and exploring different sorting techniques.


A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list of elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of elements in the respective data structure.


Here there are some sorting algorithm in repository 
1)selection sort 
time complexity =O(N^2)
space complexity = 0(1)
